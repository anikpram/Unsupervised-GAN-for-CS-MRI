# Unsupervised-GAN-for-CS-MRI
This is the code for training a generator for reconstructing images as described in the project. The code contains the following scripts:
1. trn_gen.py: Code for training the generator
2. tst_gen.py: Code for testing it on images
3. data_prep.py: Code for preparing data
4. USG.py: Code for defining the generator architecture


In order to train the generator, set the parameters carefully and run the script trn_gen.py. Towards the end of training it saves the best performing model and also saves models after specific number of epochs. Once training is done, the model can be tested in the script tst_gen.py by updating the directory of the saved model.

## Dependencies
The codes are written in Pytorch version 1.3.1. 

## Dataset
The datasets used for single channel experiments are single-channel T1-weighted brain MRI from the Calgary-Campinas Public (CCP) dataset in (https://sites.google.com/view/calgary-campinas-dataset). The single-channel complex valued images are generated by coil combination of 12-channel T1-weighted brain MRI. There are 25 subjects for training, 10 for validation and 10 for testing. There are 256 axial slices per subject with a dimension of 256 x 170.
